Our group chose to demonstrate the Spoonacular API, mainly due to it being one of the best and readily avaliable recipie APIs. We were originally going to use the food2fork API because it had a simplified version of what we needed, but it ended being taken down by the site managers so we could no longer use it. We tried to look for other API's but many of them had the same error as food2fork, which was that they were going to be taken down before we could fully utilize it. In the end, we found that Spoonacular, was one of the only recipie API's available.
