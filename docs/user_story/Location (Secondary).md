The location of the user will first be attempted to be inputted by using geolocation by displaying an alert box that requests for the user's location. IF the user accepts the geolocation request, the address field will be automatically populated. If the user declines the geolocation request, the user will be prompted to enter their address before being able to continue using the application.
