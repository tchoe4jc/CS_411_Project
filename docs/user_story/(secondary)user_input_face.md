Logged in users will have two options to record their emotion. They can either choose their mood in the drop-down menu or click on the camera icon to use facial recognition. To use the facial recognition, the users simply need to place their face in front of the front camera on their phone. If the result is not a good match, the users can rerun the facial recognition. After getting the correct emotion, the users can click on the "done" button to register.
