We wil be using Node.js and Express.js. Our alternate if we did not choose Node.js with Express.js is Django with Python. We chose Node.js because Node.js is easier to understand especially for the members in the group who have used HTML and JavaScript. The majority of members in our group have experience with JavaScript. Django and Python has a higher learning curve for those who have not used high level Python frameworks. Django requires the developers to understand the whole framework and is also more complex. In addition, Node.js has higher performance.
