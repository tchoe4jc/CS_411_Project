Project Idea 1:
Having a bad day? Hungry, Hangry, or just want something to eat to cheer you up? Our app plans to solve 1st world problems with cooking. Yes, with your own two hands. All you need to do to start using is to log in through your social media account, whichever it may be. After you’ve been authenticated, our app will run a facial recognition and match your expression with our facial recognition API. Then, you’ll need to input the current ingredients you have on you - whether it be a full fledged kitchen or ramen noodles. Based on your mood and ingredients we have, our app will recommend a recipe for you to cook.

Project Idea 2:
This app is basically your personal Baymax(Big Hero 6). It is so easy to forget to take your medication. Our app will keep track and remind you. What’s more, we will give you a clear list of foods that you cannot eat with your medication. The app also supports online shopping and searching for meds. If you don’t feel like going to the doctor, try our app to consult a doctor online. 
API: MyTelemedicine + Walgreens Pharmacy Prescription Refill + ApiMedic Symptom Checker + iHealth API + Google Map + DrugBank etc.
